The scope of our project is to create a database that can determine the Data Science and Data engineering roles easily. The main objective of this project is to create a database that can predict the future scope of data science and data engineering roles and cater to the shortage of opportunities available in the market. Since Data science is an evolving field and very crucial to today’s companies and business needs, we want to provide a platform for the students to find their desired job roles by accessing the database. The features such as location, stocks, current salary, years of experience, level, current degree,  etc will be fundamental in determining the job outcome of the individual.  By creating this database, we want to streamline a process where students and prospective employees can be made aware of the data science and data engineering roles available in the future. 

Me ( Prathamesh Kulkarni ) and Shreyas Shetty will be working in the capacity where we will be cleaning and modifying the data available. Furthermore, we will be using Machine learning algorithms to predict the future job scope of the respective individuals. This database project aims to solve the everlasting issue of job search in the field of Data science and data engineering.
